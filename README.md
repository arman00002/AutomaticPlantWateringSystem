# AutomaticPlantWateringSystem
The automated plant watering system using Arduino aims to provide an efficient solution for maintaining optimal soil moisture levels andensuring plant health. 
It aims to reduce human labour and reduces risk of plants not getting watered regularly. This is especially useful in homes when the residents are out for longer periods. 
This system primarily includes Arduino Uno, soil moisture sensor and water pump motor. Additionally, an LED and buzzer could be added to the circuit to indicate the
water pump is on. In this project an additional LED and buzzer is used as an indicator of working of the motor.
